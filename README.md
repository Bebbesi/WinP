# How to Enable Script Execution in PowerShell to Run The Script

PowerShell has security measures in place that prevent the execution of scripts by default. To run this script, you need to modify the Execution Policy.

---
## Step 1: Open PowerShell as Administrator
1. Press `Win + S` and type **PowerShell**.
2. Right-click on **Windows PowerShell** and select **Run as administrator**.
3. A PowerShell window will open with elevated privileges.

---
## Step 2: Enable Script Execution
Run the following command to allow scripts to run:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
```
When prompted, type `Y` and press **Enter** to confirm the change.

---
## Step 3: Run the Script
Navigate to the directory where your script is located using:
```powershell
cd "C:\path\to\your\script"
```
Then, execute your script with:
```powershell
.\your-script.ps1
```

---
## Step 4: Restore the Default Execution Policy (Optional)
For security reasons, you may want to restore the default Execution Policy after running your script:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser
```

---
## Troubleshooting
- If you receive a **‚ÄúPermission denied‚Äù** error, ensure you are running PowerShell as an administrator.
- If the script was downloaded from the internet, unblock it by right-clicking the file, selecting **Properties**, and checking **Unblock** under Security.

By following these steps, you will be able to run the script without restrictions. üöÄ
